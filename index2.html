        <td>The very popular and profoundly admired member of the Royal Family of England, Prince Harry attracts the attention of many people worldwide using his status as a royal, his involvement with the military of his country of origin, and his relationship with a famous actress, Meghan Markle. Born in London, United Kingdom, with the name Henry Charles Albert David, Prince Harry began his life being raised as royalty by his parents, Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales. This means that Prince Harry has spent his entire life being observed by society; however, Prince Harry uses his fame to show the masses that he is able to redefine what it means to be a member of the Royal Family in the present day. This leads him to accumulate more exposure and popularity among royal watchers and celebrity followers alike. Prince Harry has publicly spoken out about mental health on several occasions in an attempt to reduce the amount of stigma surrounding the subject. The most notable instance of this being the prince’s contribution to a health documentary he created with Oprah Winfrey. Honour and respect are given to Prince Harry by people from many countries, especially the United Kingdom, because of his ten years of service in the British Army, including several months total spent in Afghanistan, during the war there. The prince’s dedication to peacekeeping and serving his nation has been displayed very often, such as when he attended Sandhurst, a Royal Military Academy, before joining the military. During his service, he received different promotions, eventually raising him up to the rank of Captain. He also showed his acknowledgement toward the military through his creation of the Invictus Games, an international multi-sport event for wounded veterans to compete in. Being the Duke of Sussex, or any member of the British Royal Family, guarantees permanent fame, and marrying a very well-renowned actress only further increases one’s overall popularity; Prince Harry’s marriage to Meghan Markle has only amplified his relevance and importance to the media. Prince Harry and his wife have a combined net worth of approximately thirty million dollars that belongs to them. This money does not include the immense wealth belonging to anybody else in the Royal Family. Even more exposure is currently being brought upon Prince Harry and Meghan Markle thanks to their present and ongoing controversy regarding their recent decision to step down from being senior members of the Royal Family, and to move to Canada to live a more normal life. Prince Harry has made himself a royal that seems unique and more relatable, and thus he is currently the centre of attention of many forms of media. Henry Charles Albert David is one of the most famous celebrities in the present day and has proven himself to be impressive through his royal status, dedication to the military, independent thinking, and marriage to another celebrity, drawing in attention from all over the world.</td>
